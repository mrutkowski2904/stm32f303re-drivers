# Drivers for STM32F303RE
This repository contains drivers for basic peripherals of STM32F303RE MCU.

## Goal
These drivers were developed for learning purpose.

## Supported Peripherals
Following peripherals are supported:
* SPI
* I2C
* GPIO
* RCC

All of these drivers can work in blocking (delay based) mode or in interrupt mode.

## Future goals
Things I would like to implement:
* UART driver
* MCU power control
* DMA support
